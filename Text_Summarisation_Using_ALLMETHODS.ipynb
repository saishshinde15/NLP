Chelsea have been continuing talks with Leicester over a deal, but a fresh offer has now been shunned by the Foxes. Leicester have been sticking firm to a price tag of at least \\u00c2\\u00a380m for the France Under-21 international, who has made it clear to Rodgers and the club that he wants to move to west London. However, Chelsea's latest offer or around \\u00c2\\u00a370m is still substantially below Leicester's expectations and the Foxes are still not prepared to sell at the figure. The situation has moved on though, with Rodgers confirming that the club have also demoted Fofana to training with their Under-23 side after he missed a session last week - which had already resulted in him being dropped for their Premier League loss to Southampton at the weekend.

Speaking after their narrow Carabao Cup win over League Two side Stockport County, Rodgers explained the situation regarding the new bid and Fofana's status. \\u00e2\\u0080\\u009cWe\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099ve received one fresh bid for Fofana and it has been turned down,\\\" Rodgers said. \\\"He is training with the Under-23s after failing to turn up to a training session last week.\\\"\",\n          \"Granit Xhaka has rejected suggestions his move from Arsenal to Bayer Leverkusen was fuelled by his partner's desire to leave England. Xhaka agreed a \\u00e2\\u0082\\u00ac25m move to North Rhine-Westphalia in Germany after a brilliant campaign for the Gunners, helping them to second and qualification for the Champions League. His exit comes with Arsenal close to bringing in Declan Rice for a British record transfer fee as Mikel Arteta reshapes his midfield ahead of the 2023/24 season. There had been claims Xhaka's wife's unhappiness in England played a part in the 30-year-old leaving, but he has rejected that idea. Xhaka told Keystone-SDA: \\\"There was speculation everywhere that my wife was no longer happy in England. That is not at all true. feed \\\"The fact is that as a person I am always interested in new challenges. After seven years, the time has come for something completely new.  \\\"The league is not new, but the club is. During the talks with Simon Rolfes [sporting director] and Xabi Alonso, I felt that the long-term project at Leverkusen was worthwhile and that it was 100% in line with me.\\\" The Switzerland international brought a fluctuating stint with the Gunners that lasted seven years to an end by returning to the Bundesliga with Xabi Alonso's Leverkusen. He won the FA Cup twice and scored 23 goals in 297 appearances for the north London side. Xhaka won over Arsenal fans by becoming an important cog under Mikel Arteta, having previously been an outcast under Unai Emery after storming off the pitch and losing the club captaincy in 2019.\",\n          \"Manchester United have held discussions with Ajax over potential deals for both Antony and Lisandro Martinez, though the Dutch champions are looking for at least \\u00e2\\u0082\\u00ac120m for the pair. 90min has reported on United's interest in Antony since February, though efforts to sign the Brazilian winger have intensified since the club appointed Erik ten Hag as manager.  Ten Hag is targeting central midfield as his first priority to strengthen - with a deal for Barcelona's Frenkie de Jong edging closer - while the club are hopeful of convincing Christian Eriksen to join them on a free transfer. Ten Hag, though, would also like to sign an attacker.  Antony has now emerged as United's chief target in the final third, and the club have spoken to Ajax over potentially bringing the 22-year-old to England. Ajax, though, have agreed to sell Sebastien Haller to Borussia Dortmund and Ryan Gravenberch has joined Bayern Munich - meaning they do not need to sell and are prepared to demand high prices for any other outgoings. Listen now to 90min's Talking Transfers podcast, with\\u00c2\\u00a0Scott Saunders,\\u00c2\\u00a0Graeme Bailey,\\u00c2\\u00a0Harry Symeou\\u00c2\\u00a0&\\u00c2\\u00a0Toby Cudworth. On the latest show they discuss Newcastle's decision to pull out of a deal for Hugo Ekitike and offer the latest on Arsenal's pursuit of Gabriel Jesus.

If you can't see the podcast embed, click\\u00c2\\u00a0here\\u00c2\\u00a0to download the episode in full! Ajax are holding out for as much as \\u00c2\\u00a370m for Antony, though the player is pushing hard to move to United and reunite with the manager that brought him to Europe. United value Antony at a much lower fee and are hopeful the player's desire will help convince Ajax to lower their demands. United are also looking for a new centre half, and have turned their attention to Martinez having now accepted that Jurrien Timber, another Ajax player and an initial target, will not be leaving Amsterdam this summer. Arsenal are also interested in Martinez and have made two offers of their own - the latest being around \\u00c2\\u00a334m - as they look to strengthen with a player able to play in central defence, defensive midfield and at left-back. Martinez has informed Ajax he would like to leave the club this summer.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

              "'Chelsea agree Romeo Lavia fee with Southampton Chelsea have finalised an agreement with Southampton to sign midfielder Romeo Lavia, 90min understands. After striking a deal over a fee with the Saints, Chelsea set about finalising the terms of a move which sources have confirmed is worth around Â£58m including add-ons. Southampton director Jason Wilcox confirmed earlier on Tuesday that the two clubs were still in negotiations at that point, but just a few hours later, the Saints have shook hands with Chelsea and are bidding farewell to Lavia. Lavia is due to undergo a medical with Chelsea in the coming days ahead of putting pen to paper on another long-term contract at Stamford Bridge. The Belgian had the opportunity to join Liverpool this summer but, like Moises Caicedo, has opted to join Chelsea instead. feed Should all go to plan with his medical, Lavia will become the latest in a long list of new signings at Chelsea. Alongside Caicedo, the Blues have already recruited Axel Disasi, Christopher Nkunku, Nicolas Jackson, Lesley Ugochukwu, Angelo Gabriel, Robert Sanchez and Diego Moreira this summer, and they are not expected to finish there. Indeed, 90min understands Chelsea have agreed a deal to sign Crystal Palace midfielder Michael Olise, who has a Â£35m release clause in his contract with the Eagles. The Blues are then expected to turn their attention to a new goalkeeper to replace Kepa Arrizabalaga, who has joined Real Madrid on loan, while club officials have not yet ruled out pursuing another striker as well.'"
